# ModuleLoader
A lightweight and safe module management script for Roblox games. It loads and requires ModuleScripts, using protected calls (pcall) to handle errors gracefully. Includes utility functions to check for module existence and require modules by name, improving modularity and error handling in server-side code organization.
